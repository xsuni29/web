    <h1>Types of Servers and Their Uses</h1>

    <h2>1. Web Servers</h2>
    <p>Web servers are used to store, process, and deliver web pages and content to users over the internet. They handle HTTP requests and responses, serving websites and applications to users on various devices.</p>

    <h2>2. Database Servers</h2>
    <p>Database servers manage and store structured data. They are responsible for handling database queries, data retrieval, and data manipulation. These servers are critical for applications that require data storage and retrieval.</p>

    <h2>3. File Servers</h2>
    <p>File servers are used to store and manage files in a networked environment. They provide a centralized location for users to access shared files and resources, promoting collaboration and efficient file management.</p>

    <h2>4. Mail Servers</h2>
    <p>Mail servers handle email communication, sending, receiving, and storing emails. They use protocols like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) to manage email traffic.</p>

    <h2>5. Application Servers</h2>
    <p>Application servers are responsible for hosting and managing web applications and services. They process business logic, handle application-specific tasks, and manage the interaction between users and the application.</p>

    <h2>6. Proxy Servers</h2>
    <p>Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and other servers. They can enhance security, improve performance, and cache frequently requested content, reducing the load on backend servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Game Servers</h2>
    <p>Game servers are designed to host multiplayer online games. They manage player interactions, game mechanics, and data synchronization to provide a smooth gaming experience to players.</p>

    <h2>8. DNS Servers</h2>
    <p>DNS servers translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses. They play a crucial role in internet navigation, enabling users to access websites by typing domain names instead of complex IP addresses.</p>
